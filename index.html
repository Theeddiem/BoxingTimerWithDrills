      <ul class="boxing-tips">
        <li><strong>Use Your Legs:</strong> Generate power from your legs by pushing off the back foot when throwing punches. The power starts from the ground and travels through your body to the point of contact.</li>
        <li><strong>Rotate Your Hips and Shoulders:</strong> Engage your hips and shoulders when throwing punches. Rotate your body to maximize the power and reach of your punches.</li>
        <li><strong>Hand Position:</strong> Keep your hands up near your face when not punching, and bring them back quickly after each punch. This helps with both defense and quick counterattacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Chin Tucked Behind Your Lead Shoulder:</strong> Your chin should be tucked behind your lead shoulder, This position helps protect your chin from direct hits.</li>
        <li><strong>Chin Down:</strong> Ensure that your chin is slightly tucked down. This minimizes the target area for your opponent and adds an extra layer of defense.</li>
        <li><strong>Movement After Throwing a Punch:</strong> Incorporate head movement, angle changes, and distance control after delivering a punch to avoid counters and create better offensive opportunities.</li>
        <li><strong>Head Movement:</strong> Immediately after throwing a punch, incorporate head movement. This can include slipping to the side, bobbing and weaving, or rolling your head to avoid your opponent's counter punches.</li>
        <li><strong>Change Angles:</strong> Pivot or step to the side after throwing a punch to change angles. This makes it more difficult for your opponent to track your movements and counter effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Step Back or Lateral Movement:</strong> Take a step back or move laterally to create distance after delivering a punch. This helps you evade potential counters and reassess the situation.</li>
        <li><strong>Circle Away:</strong> Move in a circular pattern away from your opponent after throwing a punch. This can disrupt their line of sight and set you up for further offensive or defensive maneuvers.</li>
